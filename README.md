This is the application used for the tutorial that can be found here: [doctrine 2 and zend framework 2: A simple tutorial](http://blog.spoonx.nl/doctrine-2-and-zend-framework-2-a-simple-tutorial).

This application is very simple, having a Motd (Message of the day) module, built using Zend Framework 2, ZendSkeletonApplication and Doctrine.
It allows you to add a new message to the database, and display it again using a view helper. It is very basic and simple.
